# 🌫️ AI Health Forecast Dashboard

An AI-powered interactive dashboard that predicts how changes in air pollution impact **cardiovascular** and **respiratory** mortality rates across U.S. states (2020–2028).  
Developed using **Python**, **LSTM neural networks**, and **Streamlit**.

## 📘 Project Overview
This project integrates long-term environmental and health datasets from **EPA**, **CDC WONDER**, and **NOAA** to:

- Forecast cardiovascular and respiratory mortality trends until 2028  
- Simulate “What-If” scenarios (e.g., +10% increase in pollutants)  
- Visualize predictions on an interactive U.S. map  
- Provide AI-based interpretation of pollution impacts on human health
